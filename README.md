# Superstore
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a Superstore dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover key business insights using Python, with particular attention to profit trends and the influence of discounts on profitability. Python was used because it allows forecasts and graphs to be created.
The first script imports data from an Excel file hosted on GitHub into Python and provides a descriptive summary of the dataset.
The second script calculates the number of missing values in the Superstore dataset. The third script identifies Sean Miller as the 'whale' customer, having made the largest purchase of $25,043.05, the highest among all customers. The fourth script generates a graph showing which region has the highest sales, with the West region leading at $725,458.
The fifth script generates a graph showing the impact of discounts on profit. It illustrates that the highest profit occurs without any discount, and as the discount increases, the profit decreases. The sixth script shows that there are three categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. The average profit for each category is as follows: Furniture - $8,699.33, Office Supplies - $20,327.05, and Technology - $78,752.00. The seventh script shows that the Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier was the best-selling product, with a total sales value of $61,599.82. The eighth script shows that New York City had the most orders, with a total of 915. The ninth script shows the monthly sales data from 2011 to 2015, along with a prediction for 2016. It indicates that sales have been growing. The tenth script orders the years by total number of orders. It shows that the highest number of orders was made in 2014, with a total of 1,296. The eleventh script creates a graph showing sales by profit across three segments: Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. It reveals that most values are around $5,000, with the largest outlier being the Home Office segment, which has a value close to $25,000. The twelfth script shows the products with negative profits. The Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print has the largest negative profit, with a value of -$6,599.98. The last script creates two graphs. The first graph shows the distribution of discounts, revealing that most products have no discount (around 5,000), with the most common discount being 20% (about 3,500 products). Other discounts are marginal, with fewer than 1,000 products in each case. The second graph displays profit distribution, indicating that most profits are close to zero.
